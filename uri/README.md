# URI Online Judge solved problems

Here you can check algorithms that I did to solve problems from [URI](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/profile/158945?sort=Ranks.updatetime&direction=desc). I started solving them as a college project and now I keep solving some to train.

__Note:__ I solved most of them before learning the best practices of clean code. So I apologize for what you might find.
